## About

<center> Hi and thanks for coming across my page! Currently, I'm an undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine under the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) and majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Systems and Software. In my free time I enjoy pursuing side projects that heavily focus on how the end user interacts with the application. One of the things I enjoy most is to develop with a purpose, where every action and each decision made has a positive and significant impact on the user's experience. Thanks for visiting and if you're interested in reaching out feel free to do so below! </center>

## Work Experience

##### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory - Software Engineer Intern

##### Summer 2019

- Developed, tested, and delivered a High-Performance Computing (HPC)  CUDA application for NVIDIA GPU architectures using NVIDIA GPU programming in C/C++. The application primarily uses the cuBLAS library (CUDA Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms).
- The goal of the application was to essentially stress-test both GPU architectures being tested to find the most optimized architecture for the problem set. The two architectures being tested were NVIDIA's Volta and Kepler architectures. 
- This application was used to build the foundation of the larger project at hand, which was focused on catalysis modeling. A more in-depth overview can be found [here](https://www.orau.gov/scidac4pi2018/presentations/3-BES/02Head-Gordon_scidac4_meeting_mhg.pdf)!

## Extra Curricular 

##### NASA Aerospace Scholar

##### Ames Research Center - Software Engineer 

##### Fall 2018

- Participated in an online course hosted by NASA and was invited to participate in an on-site competition among others who excelled in the course. 
- Participated in a rover assembly competition with a team of nine other individuals at NASA's Ames Research Center. 
- Developed and tested the logic behind the rover's movements and other tasks essential to its performance, such as recognizing certain materials and changes in terrain on a simulated Mars environment. 

## Projects

##### tripleBOT - Discord Bot Application

##### Summer 2020

- Designed and developed a Discord bot using JavaScript (node.js), DynamoDB, Express, OAuth2.0, and Twitch's API. 

- tripleBOT's main purpose and inspiration was to help automate tedious tasks that would otherwise be done manually. It was unfortunate to see how many of these somewhat grueling tasks were done manually, which I believe was my signal to take action and build something to alleviate this burden. There is intended future work to build and better accommodate the future needs and wants of the server tripleBOT is designed for.

- Building this application while collaborating with the customer led me to realize my passion for building something that caters very heavily to the users' needs, all while putting the customer's needs and desires as a priority throughout development.

##### Extended Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path

##### Fall 2019

- Developed an algorithm in C++ that builds a graph using handwritten HashGraph, HashMap and HashSet using open addressing, an adjustable heap priority queue, and a LocalInfo class, which stores out/in nodes and out/in edges of each node in the graph.
- Computes the minimum cost and shortest path between any two nodes and displays these results.
